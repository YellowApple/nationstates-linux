To compile on archlinux install the packages:
	pacman -Sy libxml++ gtkmm3 curl base-devel

Select all and then use the build command:
	make all

Run with 
	./nationstates


If you can not build it, or want to build it on another distro, use your preferred package manager to install the packages named something like these:
	libxml++ gtkmm3 curl

Then run double click the nationstates file in the bin folder.
	./bin/nationstates


If you want to brave it on windows, download and install gtk for windows:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-win/files/latest/download

After that, I have no idea. Try running the ./bin/nationstates file and report back.
